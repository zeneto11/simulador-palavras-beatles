Whoo!
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
To your mother!

It's all too much 
It's all too much 

When I look into your eyes 
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside 
The more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

Floating down the stream of time 
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake 
So take a piece but not too much 

Sell me on a silver sun 
Where I know that I'm free 
Show me that I'm everywhere 
And get me home for tea 

It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give, the more you get
The more it is and it's too much

Nice to have the time to take
This opportunity
Time for me to look at you
And you to look at me

It's all too much for me to see 
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know 
And what I do is all too much 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

It's too much
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
You're too much
We are getting better

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Childlike, no one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah?) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
Hey!

Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog

Do you know any more?
Awoo arf!
Ah-ha-ha!
You've got it! That's it! You've got it! That's it, man! Whoo! That's it, you've got it!
Don't look at me, man, I only have ten children. Hoo!
Ah-ho! Ha-ha-ha aarrh ha-ha-ha!
Quiet, boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!

Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When/As it's only a northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no-one there
