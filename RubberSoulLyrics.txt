Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"

I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said, "Baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"
Beep beep mm beep beep, yeah

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl I could start right away
When she said, "Listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"

Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
I once had a girl or should I say
She once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good
Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good
Norwegian wood?
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh ooh ooh

Girl
Girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

Ah, girl
Girl, girl
If I needed someone to love 
You're the one that I'd be thinking of 
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone 
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this 
But, you see, now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall 
And maybe you will get a call from me 
If I needed someone 

Ah, ah, ah, ah 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend

If I needed someone 

Ah, ah
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
You don't know what you're missing (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Nowhere man (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
The world is at your command (aaah-aah-lala-lala-la)

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Take your time; don't hurry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Leave it all (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Till somebody else lends you a hand (aaah-aah-lala-lala)

Doesn't have a point of view

I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Your lips are moving 
I cannot hear 
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear 
You don't sound different 
I've learned the game 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me 
The same old way 
You were above me 
But not today 
The only difference 
Is you're down there 
I'm looking through you
And you're nowhere 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Aah, and I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you 
A-you've changed, you've changed 
You've changed, you've changed
Yes, you've changed
I'm looking
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life trying
Just to make you toe the line

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
I catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no-one compares with you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
In the beginning I misunderstood 
But now I've got it
The word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free 
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Now that I know what I feel must be right 
I'm here to show everybody the light 

Give the word a chance to say 
That the word is just the way 
It's the word I'm thinking of 
And the only word is love 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word
Love
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

But if your heart breaks 
Don't wait
Turn me away 
And if your heart's strong 
Hold on
I won't delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
I'll trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 

It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why 

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no-one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

I don't know why you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Should want to hide (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I can't get through (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
My hands are tied (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I won't want to stay (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I don't have much to say (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I'd get turned away (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
They're filled with tears (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And since I lost you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
It feels like years (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And I just can' go on (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
