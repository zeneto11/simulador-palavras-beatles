For I have got another girl
Another girl

You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

Another girl
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
They're going to put me in the movies
They're going to make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I’ll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I’ll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally
If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realise now?
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me 'fore I grow too old

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizz, Lizzy
Ooh, girl, you look so fine
Just a-rockin' an' a-rollin'
Girl, I said I wish you were mine

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Ooh, baby
Say you're driving me insane
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
I want to be your loving man

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy, Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin'
Ooh, I said I wish you were mine
Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone
Help!

(When)
When I was younger
(When I was young)
So much younger than today
(I never need)
I never needed anybody's help in any way

(Now)
But now these days are gone
(These days are gone)
I'm not so self-assured
(And now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now)
And now my life has changed
(My life has changed)
In oh, so many ways
(My indepen)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze

(But)
But every now and then
(Now and then)
I feel so insecure
(I know that I)
I know that I just need you like
I never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger
So much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way

(Now)
But now these days are gone
(These days are gone)
I'm not so self-assured
(And now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Help me, help me, ooh!
We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Yes

When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before (Hey)

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh my
When you sigh, my my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes night-time bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes, it's so hard loving you
Loving you
You don't realise how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you

Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?

I didn't realise
As I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you

I need you

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
