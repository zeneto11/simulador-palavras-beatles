Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh

Baby, You're a Rich Man
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
(Baby)
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man (baby)
Baby, you're a rich man, too

(Wahoo!)
Baby, you're a rich (whoo) man
Baby, you're a (hey) rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)
There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long (don't be long)
Please don't you be very long (don't be long)
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Now, it's past my bed, I know (know)
And I'd really like to go (go)
Soon will be the break of day (day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

Please don't be long (don't be long)
Please don't you be very long (don't be long)
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long

Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the Eggman (whoo!)
They are the Eggmen (whoo!)
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister city policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm cry-'-ng (Ahhh!)
I'm crying
I'm cry-'- (whoooo!)

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the Eggman
They are the Eggmen
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

I am the Eggman (Now, good sir, ...)
They are the Eggmen (... poor man, made tame to fortune's...)
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob

Expert texpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(Ho-ho-ho! Hee-hee-hee! Ha-ha-ha!)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they schnied
I'm crying

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
