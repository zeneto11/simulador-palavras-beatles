Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her
But she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him

Oh, how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

Oh, how long will it be
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
One day you'll look 
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know 
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask, I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Well, they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby

Fifty women knocking on my door

When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does

When I'm with her I'm happy

I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone
Please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

Mr. Moonlight

You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you send my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Come again, please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please

On the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

On the night you don't come my way
Oh, I pray and pray more each day
'Cos we love you

Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight...
This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through
Your window

I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me 'cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man
In my place

If I were you I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

No reply

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
And she declaim a man a wailin' sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks were dancin' and got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep on rockin' that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a black beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oughta got rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

Please, stop your lying
You got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

Please stop your lying
You have got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me
Hold me close
And tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real

Words of love
You whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

Let me hear you say
The words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near

Words of love you
Whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
