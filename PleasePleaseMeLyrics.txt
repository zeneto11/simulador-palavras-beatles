Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him
You can go with him, girl
Go with him

One, two, three, four!

Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine
My happiness, dear, makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
You

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

You should hear what they say about you
Cheat, cheat
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Don't leave me all alone
Come on home

Can't run around

The world is treating me bad
Misery

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad
Misery

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag
Misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one?
Only one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one
Lonely one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
In misery
My misery

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Doo doo n'doo
Doo doo n'doo

I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though we're far apart

That taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back)
For the honey (For the honey)
And you
