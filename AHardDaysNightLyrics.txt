I give her all my love, that's all I do
And if you saw my love, you'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I'll feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow!

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know, I feel all right
You know, I feel all right

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathise
Don't you be sad
Just call me tonight

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Can't buy me love, oh
Love, oh
Can't buy me love, oh

I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right

'Cause I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you

I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, oh
Everybody tells me so

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

If it's something I'd have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

Well, I beggin' on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my please
Is there anything that I can do?
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me, too
But I got a big surprise, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you, oh

You, if you break my heart, I'll go
But I'll be back again

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Some day when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Some day when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

If I catch you talking
To that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Well, it's the second time
I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time

And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
'Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So, please listen to me
If you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings
