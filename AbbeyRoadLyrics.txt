Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking but she looks like a man (aah-aah-aah)
Well, you should see her in drag (aaah)
Dressed in her polythene bag (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam (aah-aah-aah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a belly full of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm gonna make her mine
Oh listen to that now
Heh-heh-heh!
Oh, look out!
Yeah

She came in through the bathroom window (ahh-ooooh)
Protected by a silver spoon (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
By the banks of her own lagoon (ooooh-ooh)

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew, but I could not say

And so I quit the Police Department (ahh-ooooh)
And got myself a steady job (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
And though she tried her best to help me (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
She could steal, but she could not rob (ooooh-ooh)

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
Joan was quizzical, 
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure she was dead 

Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, oh-oh, oh"
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead 

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

P.C. 31 said "We've caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free ("Maxwell must go free")
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so, oh-oh, oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead 
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

Silver hammer man

Oh, darling
If you leave me

Believe me when I beg you - ooh!
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didn't need me any more
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me any more
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and died

Oh, darling
If you leave me

Believe me when I tell you

Believe me, darling

When you told me (whoo)
You didn't need me any more
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and cried

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm
Below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Here come the sun king
Here come the sun king

Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy

Here come the sun king

Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
(Ahhhhh ah-ahhhh-a-ah)
(Ahhhhh ah-ahhhh-a-ah)
(Ahhhhh ah-ah a-ah a-ah)

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags, get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true
Today
Came true
Today
Came true
Today
Yes, it did
'N ah ah ah ah ah ah-h ah

The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
