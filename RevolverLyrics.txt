Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken 
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken 
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round

You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
And your bird can swing 
But you can't hear me 
You can't hear me
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A life time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
Somehow, someway

What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

Then we lie
Beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she does)
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day)
She said
"I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like
I've never been born

I said
"Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like
I've never been born"

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,
Everything was right.
Everything was right."

I said
"Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like
I've never been born."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,
Everything was right.
Everything was right."

I said
"Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like
I've never been born."

She said, she said
"I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad.
I know what it is to be sad.
I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it's like to be dead."
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never die
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)

Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)

Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me
It's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind
And tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

I've got time
One, two, three, four (for you, nineteen for me)
One, two (one, two, three, four)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

(If you drive a car, car)
I'll tax the street
(If you try to sit, sit)
I'll tax your seat
(If you get too cold, cold)
I'll tax the heat
(If you take a walk, walk)
I'll tax your feet
Taxman

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
(Ha, ha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Ha, ha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman)
Turn off your mind
Relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying

Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining

That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being

That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing

But listen to the
Colour of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living

Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

Of the beginning
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
