The Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue 
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 

Walk, walk, cat, walk
Go, Johnny, go!
Same old twelve-bar blues

Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby!

I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm having the blues
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
(Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rosetta
Level, John?

Sweet Loretta Fart
She thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin

Rosetta
Yeah?
The pickup!
Picks for the fingers, great
Oh, me
Okay
One, two
One, two, three, four

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo Jo

Go home
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Go home
Oh, get back
Yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back

Oooh!

Thanks, Mo!
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition
"I Dig a Pygmy", by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard-earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day
I me mine

I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine

All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day
I me mine

I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine

All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life
I me mine
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai guru deva

My baby says she's travelling
On the one after 909 
I said
Move over honey 
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go 
And I begged her on my bended knee (yes, I did)
You're only fooling 'round
Only fooling 'round with me
I said
Move over once 
Move over twice 
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bags, run to the station 
Railman said
You've got the wrong location 
Pick up the bag, run right home 
Then I find I've got the number wrong

The altar men are calling
Like a rolling stone

Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B. B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby
Dig it

That was "Can You Dig It?" by Georgie Wood (dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it)
And now we'd like to do "Hark the Angels Come" (dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it)
