She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalise
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

No, she's an angel sent to me

Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame, it's plain to see

So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
That she would leave me on my own
It's just not right
When every night I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

We're gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hit it again today

You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blown a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps a-singing the blues
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm revues
Roll over, Beethoven
Rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further and a-reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over, Beethoven
A-rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin'
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle, diddle
I'm a-playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she winks like a glow worm
Dives like a spinnin' top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see him reel an' rock
'S long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Well, roll over, Beethoven
Yeah, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Oh, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Till there was you

I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Tighter
Tighter
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
