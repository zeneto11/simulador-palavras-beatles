She was a working girl
North of England way
(Now, she's hit the big time)
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

Oh, honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend
Of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

Oo
Yeah

I like it like that (oo, ah)
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me? t-t-tee
Now, honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
Hoo-woo-doo ooh-ooh
Bo bo
Buh-huh-buh wa-ooh-uh bo bo
Honey pie, honey pie
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty
Sound of music as she flies

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mm, Mother Nature's son
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Mm
Da-da-da-da-da-da da
Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)

Yeah

In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha)

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (arm!) (leg!)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Yes!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra

I'm so tired
I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired
My mind is on the blink
I wonder, should I get up and fix myself a drink?
No, no, no

I'm so tired
I don't know what to do
I'm so tired
My mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you
But I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

I'm so tired
I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired
I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

One more time
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia
Oceanchild calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

Julia, seashell eyes
Windy smile calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun

Julia, Julia
Morning moon touch me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind
Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud
Touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia

Mm
Calls me
So I sing the song of love for
Julia, Julia, Julia
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?

It took a long, long, long time
Now, I'm so happy I found you
How I love you

So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh

Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

Oh
Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look; you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other
Silly girl

Hold your hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration, please
Be good to be
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear
Bottle of claret for you if I'd realised.
Well, do next time.
I'd forgotten all about it, George, so I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?
Yes.
Cheeky bitch.

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Every one of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen times
Your fibres giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I sustained nothing worse than
Also spoken for
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number 9, number 9, number 9

Right, right
Right, right, right, right
Right, right

9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, ahaâ€¦

9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

Number 9, number

Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Who could tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive was high
And his eyes were low

All right!

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

So the wife called, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it
Right!
Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for wearing

Um da
Aaah

How?
The dogs were dogging, the cats were catting
The birds were birding, and the fish were fishing
The men were themming, and the when were whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this, brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's not that; it's
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Exposures in London
It's a difficulty being
By exposure
Because it's almost like being naked

If you become naked

That line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line

Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Right, take two, OK!

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out-in
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We all doing what we can
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

All right
All right
All right, all right
All right, all right
All right, all right
All right, all right
All right
All right

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy name o' Rocky Raccoon-a
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon
Checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come
Equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival, it seems
Had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill
And she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now, she and her man
Who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
A-Rocky burst in
And grinning a grin
He said, "Danny, boy, this is a showdown!"

But Daniel was hot
And he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Aah

Da-d'n da da da da da
Daa-d'l da da da da da
Daa-d'l da da da da da
Da-da da da-da ndoo ndoo-doo-doo
Dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
Dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
Doo doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
Doo-doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
La-ta ndoo dloo-doo-doo

Now the doctor came in
Stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better
I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

A-now Rocky Raccoon
He fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Daa da-da-da)
A-Gideon checked out (Poor)
And he left it no doubt (Rocky)
To help with good Rocky's revival (Ohhh)

Aah
Oh, yeah, yeah'n
Doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Ndoo doo-doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo doo
Come on, Rocky, boy
Dooo d'n-doo doo doo-doo
Come on, Rocky, boy
Doo doo doo doo doo-ta-doo ta-doo-ta-da
A story of Rocky, da-da-da
Creme tangerine, Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
When the pain cuts through
You're gonna know, and how!
The sweat is gonna fill your head (whoa)
When it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know o-bla-di-bla-da
But can you show me where you are?

Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Hey, Bungalow Bill

Eh up!
I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and so-old you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
(With) every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Yeah

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently wee-ee-eeps

Yeah, yeah, yeah

And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eyes
The worm he licks my bone
Feel so suicidal 
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jone
Lonely
Wanna die 
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why

The black cloud crossed my mind 
Blue mist 'round my soul 
Feel so suicidal 
Even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die 
Yeah, wanna die 
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why

(Turn it up)

Yes, I'm lonely

Happy birthday to you
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The duchess of Kirkcaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting 'round the table
For a sÃ©ance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

Can you take me back
Where I've been from?
Can you take me back?

Can you take me back
Where I've been from?
Brother, can you take me back?
Can you take me back?

Mm, can you take me
Where I've been from?
Can you take me
Back?
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence
Greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?

Dear Prudence
Open up your eyes
Dear Prudence
See the sunny skies
The wind is low, the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence
Won't you open up your eyes?

Look around, 'round
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
Look around, 'round, 'round
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
Look around

Dear Prudence
Let me see you smile
Dear Prudence
Like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence
Won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence
Greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a-ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a-moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said, that's all right
I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know, the place where nothing is real
Well, here's another place you can go-o
Where everything flo-ows
Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixin' the hole in the ocean
Tryin' to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Now, it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mm, mm

Good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night
She's not a girl who misses much
Do-do do-do do-do
Oh, yeah

She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirror's on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust

I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
